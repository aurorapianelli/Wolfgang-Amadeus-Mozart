The following article explores the life and cultural heritage of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - one of the greatest composers of the classical period, whose unfading impact is up to this day vividly observed in modern-day art and culture.  Our data story is comprised of three major parts. In the first part, we will introduce a brief data-set on Mozart’s biography supported by multiple graphs and tables provided by Melody. In the second part we will provide an overview on Mozart’s overall career. Finally, in the last part of our data set we will  touch upon the ways, in which Mozart’s figure is represented in our contemporary art and culture. <br>
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on January 27, 1756 in Salzburg, Archduchy of Austria. His father, Leopold Mozart, was a famous composer, violinist and theorist. He is considered to be one of the first influencers of Mozart’s career. Leopold Mozart dedicated his entire life to his son’s development as a musician, making sure that the latter is recognized in the major courts of Europe. Despite his father’s great efforts to orient his son towards Europe, the latter ended up working in Salzburg and Vienna. The relationship between the father and the son worsened, when 26-year-old Mozart against his father’s will decided to marry Constanze Weber, who he had 2 children with. <br>
As a musician, Mozart had a highly prolific career, throughout which he created a huge number of compositions belonging to various genres. The following table represents the list of his most notable works. As it shows, the vast majority of Mozart’s compositions are operas and singspiels (a type of opera, subsequently innovated and improved by Mozart himself). <img src='notable works 1.png' align='left' hspace='20' vspace='10' width='400' heigt='100'>

Moreover, during 1769-1773 Mozart made three Italian journeys, which were of huge inspiration for the young musician, who managed to complete overall 23 compositions. <img src='compositions per year.png' align='right' hspace='20' vspace='10' width='500' heigt='200'>
